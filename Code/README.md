# Social-Performance-Estimator
 Predicting Social Media Performance Using Machine Learning with a Personalized Dataset.

 This project, as part of the Machine Learning Engineering Class (Spring 2024) at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, will instigate a supervised regression ML model to predict the popularity (in the amount of "likes") that a proposed image will generate given a precedent of images (validated through feature vector extraction) and their likes as a target. 


# Code: Here, I will store the Main code that I will write for the project (in the form of a jupyter notebook .ipynb file)

# Data: Here, I will store the Data that I have generated for the project.
The data (in the form of a folder of .jpg files and a .txt file) is created entirely from my private instagram account, @mythicane. Feel free to replace this data with your own following the naming conventions in the main.ipynb file (and follow along the jupyter notebook file when processing data and training/testing/validating model!)
