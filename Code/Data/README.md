# Social-Performance-Estimator
 Predicting Social Media Performance Using Machine Learning with a Personalized Dataset.

 This project, as part of the Machine Learning Engineering Class (Spring 2024) at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, will instigate a supervised regression ML model to predict the popularity (in the amount of "likes") that a proposed image will generate given a precedent of images (validated through feature vector extraction) and their likes as a target. 


# Data: Here, I will store the data that I will create/wrangle/process for the project
